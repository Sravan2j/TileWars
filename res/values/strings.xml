    <string name="about_screen_credits">"This game is inspired by the iOS game 'TileWars', developed by Tyler McAtee and Joel Green.\n\nTileWars is a tile flipping game with four modes.\n1) SpeedTile: Play against the stop watch when Tiles are flipped at an increasing rate. Touch the flipped Tiles to keep playing. Game ends when ten Tiles are flipped before you unflip them.\n2) MemoryTile: Remember which Tiles appear and identify the same to advance to the next round. Don't be fooled when the Tiles start swapping.\n3) FlipTile: Play with a friend in turns of two. Each flip by a player turns all the adjacent Tiles of the opponent to their color. Player with highest number of Tiles at the end of the game wins.\n4) ChainTile: This mode is similar to FlipTile, where players take turns flipping Tiles and try to get the most of their color towards the end. However, each player gets one turn and when more than 2 adjacent tiles are flipped, a chain reaction starts as bonus. During this chain reaction, your tile swaps with other random tile of your color. At this new swapped position, it flips adjacent tiles to your color again and so on. The number of times it swaps and flips depends on your score in the current turn. "</string>
